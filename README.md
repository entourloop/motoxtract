A program to read the partition details in Motorola Bootloader File (motoboot.img)

Installation and Usage:
Step 1: gcc motoxtract.c -o motoxtract
Step 2: chmod a+wx motoxtract
Step 3: ./motoxtract <filename.img>

I have attached a precompiled object code on this git repo. You can skip Step 1 if you are using it.
